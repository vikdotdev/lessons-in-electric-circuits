## Lessons In Electric Circuits by Tony R. Kuphaldt in **.epub**
This book had great success in introducing me to electronics and I hope to thank the author by spreading the word and making it more accessible and convenient for others to read.

I do not own any of the presented work, all credit goes to Tony R. Kuphaldt and contributors.

## How do I get the **epub**?
Checkout repos' [releases](https://github.com/vikdotdev/lessons-in-electric-circuits/releases). If yu have access to fantastic program `pandoc` you can run the following commands to compile your very own **epub**:

```
